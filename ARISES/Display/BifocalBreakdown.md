# Bifocal Display Breakdown

Bifocal display is where the most important infomation are displayed on the main graph while less relevant data is displayed on the side views. Scroll across x-axis would allow users to access detailed data on a selected date.

**As the image shown below:**

Only range bars are shown on the side indicating maxima, minima and average.  The monitored glucoses, popups (meals, exercises, insulin dosages) and prediciton (only if main graph is on today) are plotted on main graph.
