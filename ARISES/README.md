#  Nav Section
## Stage One (Wednesday)

## MVC Split 
### Model
- None
### View 
- Backgrounds for each section
- 4 expanded views
- 4 contracted views
- *contracted views have "states" and any widgets move to be visible based on those*
- Set each view to be "connected" so only a few variables to adjust
- Titles for each view
- Symbols for each view
### Controller
- Buttons to select Views (expand/contract)
- Actions to exand/contract
- *ensure only one view expanded at a time*
- AutoLayout for all
