# Client Design

Before we joined the project, the client team had come up with a design of what the app should look like and what features it should include.  The requirements were as follows:

#### Interface
* There should be no menus or navigational hierarchy and all content should be accessible within one click.
* All important information should be visible at all times.
* The patient’s blood glucose level and recommended insulin doses should be displayed on a bifocal display graph. A bifocal display         is a way of showing one set of information in detail, and a second set in summary for context using a 3D transform. Swiping along         the display should allow the secondary information to be brought to the fore. In this case the main face would show one day’s             worth of blood glucose data (default: today’s data) and the sidebars would show summary information about previous days for               context, and the user could swipe through the days.

#### Features
* Should contain 4 domains: food, exercise, education and health as well as the afore mentioned bifocal graph. 
* The food and exercise sections should allow the user to input meals and exercise activities respectively, including nutritional           information, exercise duration and time of day.
* The health section should let the user view trends and enter miscellaneous information that may be relevant.
* The education section should contain advice and links to new information about diabetes management.
