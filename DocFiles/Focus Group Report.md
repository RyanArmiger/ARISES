# Focus Group Report 06/06/218

**Attendees**
* Patients – Megan Blisset, Philippa Cooper
* Investigators – Chukwuma Uduku, Robert Spence, Kehzi Li, John Daniels, Narvada Jungee, Rebecca Elkington, Ryan Armiger, Jack Pearson, Camille Demasson

**Hone Screen*** 
* General layout of domains and bifocal display well received
* Integrate function to swipe and reveal customisable data in the corners of domains. Suggestions below
  * Meals domain - Last meal (total CHO and bolus insulin delivered), Insulin on-board, Active Carbs
  * Exercise domain - Heart rate
  
**Bi-Focal Display**
Agreed proposals
* Current Blood glucose to be large & central with trend arrow
* Date should include day of the week
* Ability click on current date and select a historical date for interrogation
* Limit previous days represented on bifocal display to 3
* Increase size of display to maximise screen real estate
* Timestamped food to be placed on the graph at different heights relative to CHO content (High CHO meal plotted above low CHO)
* Consider loss of predicted future glucose trajectory & historical glucose data when approaching the end & entering a new day respectively
* Consider use of empty bifocal display once entering a new day
* Insulin is a priority
  * Correction in food and add to food logs
  * Insulin section, displaying on board etc
Ideas in debrief
* Incorporation of basal rate graph (possibly in the target glucose space with Y-axis values on the right)
* Use of pastel colours for graph background. Considering darker shades out of range with a smooth gradient to a light shade in target range (feedback on ideas would be appreciated)
* Timestamped Insulin bolus function added to bifocal display

**Meals/Food Domain**
Agreed proposals
* To overcome time discrepancies around pre-bolus insulin, all meals require user to enter planned time of ingestion
* Preference to manually enter figures for macronutrients
* Adding photos to favourite meals well received
* Consider use of scanning barcodes to pull macronutrient content. (Potential drawbacks include: - portion size, units, cooking methods)
* Show previous delta blood glucose rise and bolus insulin required when choosing a previously selected meal
* Incorporate alcohol (units)
* Display how recommended bolus insulin split (Correction & Meal)
Ideas in debrief
* Quantitative CHO log & qualitative protein and fat (low, mid, high)
* Incorporate a library with macronutrient content common meals

**Exercise**
Agreed Proposals
* Factor aerobic, anaerobic & mixed exercise
* Consider app logging periods of increased activity for future review (not an alert)

**Health**
Agreed Proposals
* Offer user additional & customisable tags for retrospective review (e.g. menstrual cycle, travel)
* Popup calendar to retrospectively identify filtered parameters well received

**Advice**
* Use this domain for identified trends, warnings, possible basal insulin adjustments (e.g. temperature and blood glucose trend, weekend hyperglycaemia, overnight hypo’s etc..)
* Interaction with advice will brush evidence on bifocal display
* Ability to dismiss suggestions, can get annoying if repeated
* Education is unnecessary, would have education before given the app and don’t want to encourage belief that it is an alternative.
* Swipe across to see general statistics (e.g. total CHO, total exercise, total insulin delivered, glucose mean & range etc…)

**Miscellaneous**
* Alarms: Options for do not disturb unless an emergency
* Adjusting info level is important: Personalise from experienced to basic or children
* Prioritise functionality
* Personalisation important
