# Focus Group Report 06/06/218

**Attendees**
* Patients – Megan Blisset, Philippa Cooper
* Investigators – Chukwuma Uduku, Robert Spence, Kehzi Li, John Daniels, Narvada Jungee, Rebecca Elkington, Ryan Armiger, Dan Wells, Camille Demasson
* Minutes and report compiled by - Chukwuma Uduku

**Hone Screen*** 
* General layout of domains and bifocal display well received
Agreed Prroposals
* Allow the user to swipe through different (customisable) information in the status indicators. Content suggestions below:
  * Meals domain - Last meal (total CHO and bolus insulin delivered), Insulin on-board, Active Carbs
  * Exercise domain - Heart rate
  
**Bi-Focal Display**
Agreed Proposals
* Current Blood glucose to be large & central with trend arrow
* Date at the top should include day of the week
* Ability to click on current date and  from their select any historical date to jump to
* Limit number of previous days represented on the bi-focal sidebands to three
* Increase size to maximise usage of screen real estate
* Timestamped food to be placed on the graph at different heights relative to CHO content (High CHO meal plotted above low CHO)
* Consider loss of predicted future glucose trajectory & historical glucose data when approaching the end & entering a new day respectively
* Consider use of a new, empty bifocal display when entering a new day
* Ability to enter insulin doses is essential. A few ideas:
  * Eter correction in food and add to food logs. This is a problem for doses not taken with meals.
  * Insulin section, displaying on board etc.
Ideas in debrief
* Incorporation of temporary basal rate on the graph (possibly with Y-axis values on the right)
* Use of pastel colours for graph background. Considering darker shades out of range with a smooth gradient to a light shade in target range
* Add insulin bolus to the bi-focal display, similar to with food and exercise activities

**Meals/Food Domain**
Agreed proposals
* To overcome time discrepancies around pre-bolus insulin, all meals require user to enter planned time of ingestion
* Preference to manually enter figures for macronutrients above using a picker
* Adding photos to favourite meals well received
* Consider use of scanning barcodes to pull macronutrient content. (Potential drawbacks include: - portion size, units, cooking methods)
* Show previous delta blood glucose rise and bolus insulin required when choosing a previously selected meal
* Incorporate alcohol (units)
* Be able to access detailed information about a recommended insulin dose (e.g. Amount in correction and amount for meal)
Ideas in debrief
* Quantitative CHO log & qualitative protein and fat (low, mid, high)
* Incorporate a library with macronutrient content common meals

**Exercise**
Agreed Proposals
* Be able to specify if exercise is aerobic, anaerobic or mixed
* Consider the app logging periods of increased activity for future review (not an alert)

**Health**
Agreed Proposals
* Offer user additional & customisable tags for retrospective review (e.g. menstrual cycle, travel)
* Popup calendar to retrospectively identify filtered parameters well received

**Advice**
* Use this domain for identified trends, warnings, possible basal insulin adjustments (e.g. temperature and blood glucose trend, weekend hyperglycaemia, overnight hypo’s etc..)
* Interaction with advice will brush evidence on bifocal display
* Ability to dismiss suggestions, can get annoying if repeated
* Education is unnecessary, would have education before given the app and don’t want to encourage belief that it is an alternative.
* Swipe across to see general statistics (e.g. total CHO, total exercise, total insulin delivered, glucose mean & range etc…)

**Miscellaneous**
* Alarms: Options for do not disturb unless an emergency
* Adjusting info level is important: Personalise from experienced to basic or children
* Prioritise functionality
* Personalisation important
