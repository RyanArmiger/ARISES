# Meeting Minutes

### 01/05/18 – Meeting 1  

**Discussion:**
* Given basic design requirements 
  * No hierarchy - all content accessible on one/page 
  * All key information visible at all times 
  * 'Bi-focal display' of one day's glucose levels and important info highlighted e.g. meals, hypos 
  * Button to access summary data 
* Briefed on basic aims 
  * Demonstrate app, UI, inputting of food/exercise data and trends sorting 

**Decisions:**
* Weekly meetings

**To Action (for next meeting):**
* Get access to Macs from IT
* Start learning the swift programming language
* Create a rough project timeline and plan
* Come up with specific design ideas to implement the requirements

### 04/05/18 - Meeting 2

**Actioned:** 
* Project timeline and plan produced 
* Some specific designs for domains created. 

**Discussion:**
* Bottom Half
  * Food/Exercise: Discussed whether we need a record of entered meals/exercise and how they would be entered in the first place, i.e. using text fields, selection from a series of pictures or in a pop-up. 
* Top Half (bi-focal display): 
  * Bifocal side bars should show dots indicating minimum, maximum and average blood glucose level for that day.  
  * Discussed whether separating things into breakfast, lunch and dinner on both the graph and in the food domain was a good idea given people don't necessarily have regular eating habits.  

**Decisions:** 
* No need to separate based on breakfast, lunch and dinner. 
* Food/exercise to be entered without requiring a pop-up to minimise clicks. 

**To Action:**
* Create the bubbles for the domain and make them come to the front if clicked on. 
* The client to provide us with sample data to use in the bifocal display. 
* Research how to create a bi-focal graph. 

### 09/05/18 - Meeting 3

**Actioned:**
* Basic floating bubbles created 
* Progress made towards bifocal display 

**Discussion:** 
* Whether floating bubbles or more conventual tab navigational system would be better. Advantages of tab system include user familiarity, more space being available for content in each window and a standard library of features to make coding easier. Advantages of floating bubbles include the ability to put status indicators in the corner, innovation and reduction in cognitive load for user. 
* How should data be entered to meals and exercise. 

**Decisions:** 
* To create two prototype apps, one using tabs and the other using floating bubbles. 
* Wherever possible data entry should happen via picker menus (e.g. for times and duration). 

**To Action:** 
* Create two different app layouts to compare 
* Add stand in text fields, buttons and tables to the different domains 
* Make further progress on the bifocal display 
* //Question mark about how far we were at on bifocal 

### 16/05/18 - Meeting 4

**Actioned:**  
* Both Tabs and Floating bubbles concepts produced 
* Basic graph with skewed (but not functional) sidebands produced and demonstrated 

**Discussion:** 
* Navigation functionality 
* User experience 
* Basal rates 

**Decisions:** 
* Standard IOS tabs concept rejected by client based on months of investment the team hadn’t been briefed on 
* Mac will be made available to use in Bob’s office 
* Colour scheme will avoid those difficult for colour-blind users 
* In-depth user experience will be delayed in favour of progress of functionality 
* Exercise will be moved to top right to allow keyboard space 
* Insulin input/information will be on graph not bottom section 
* A focus group will be scheduled in June 

**To Action:**
