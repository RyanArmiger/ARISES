# Ethics Report

### Benefits

#### Diabetes Management

This app will allow patients to track their blood glucose levels and have better estimates for how
much insulin, making them less likely to experience hypo or hyperglycaemia which can lead to
serious health complications. Even excluding extreme events better blood glucose control in the long
term can lead to a reduction in Hb1ac levels which if reduced by only 1.5% can lead to an increase in
life expectancy of 23 years.

Furthermore, being able to follow trends in the health and advice section can help patients better
understand what factors effect their blood glucose levels and spot long term trends before they
become an urgent problem.

#### Government Spending

In 2010/11 diabetes cost the UK government £23.7 billion in both direct costs through the NHS and
indirect costs in loss of productivity from time taken off work. Being able to spot problems early and
avoid them in the first place means that diabetics will lead to huge savings for the government as
patients will have to visit A&amp;E less which is the most expensive form of treatment. Furthermore, less
complications will mean less time will need to be taken off work, leading to further savings.

### Concerns

#### Data Protection

One key ethical concern with our project is data protection. The app will store on a database records
of an individual’s blood glucose levels, exercise and eating habits. Especially the last two would be
valuable data for companies who partake in targeted advertising, as if, for instance, you knew
someone did yoga you could send them adverts for yoga pants. Equally Krispy Kreme would be very
interested to know if someone ate a donut every day and they may be able to work out where they
bought it from based on the nutritional information. The likelihood of this occurring, as the NHs is a
government agency whose main incentive is patient protection as opposed to profit and this
information being shared would lead to a government scandal.

#### Insulin Dose Miscalculaton

Other ethical concerns are that bugs in the algorithm could lead to miscalculation of an insulin dose
which a patient might blindly follow and go into hypo/hyperglycaemia. To mitigate this, it would be
wise to have as much information as possible about how the dosage was calculated available (i.e.
how much of it is basal correction, how much is meal correction etc.) to let the user sanity check the
result. A rigorous testing process on the eventual algorithm will have to be carried out to quantify
and minimise this risk, however this does not relate to the part of the project we are working on.
