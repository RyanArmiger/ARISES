# Future Work

* Create a list of customisable options for the settings menu (e.g. new tags) and possibly make the button trigger a pop-up rather than a redirect.
* Make the trend arrow rotate to correspond to blood glucose level trajectory.
* Get the edit meal button in the food section working.
* Ability to take pictures of meals by clicking on the camera icon in the corresponding row and possibly allow favourite meal selection via the food carousel described in the design process seciton.
* All the cells in the exercise log to expand to make room for an edit button and then get this button working so users can cancel or change the duration/time of exercise.
* Allow the user to change which tag switches are present and define new ones, either through the settings method or directly in the health domain. Also need to make tag filters customisable.
* Make it identify and report trends to the user in the advice section.
* Make it be able to create summary graphs from the data, for instance average blood glucose level against time of day, number of hypos against day of the week etc.
* Allow the user to swipe through these charts in the advice section.
* Let the user click a button to expand any of these charts as a pop-up for more detail.
* Include an option under settings to let the user clear their data.
