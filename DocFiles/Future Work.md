# Future Work

* Expand the number of customisable features accessible via the settings menu and possibly make the settings button trigger a pop-up rather than a redirect. Options that need to be added to the settings menu:
  * Which tags are present in the health section (e.g. stress, illness, menstruation, travel).
  * Which filters are present in the health section.
  * The ability to define new tags.
  * How much information about insulin dose calculations is displayed.
  * Whether an add alcohol option is present.
  * The ability to clear all stored data.
  * A do not disturb period for alerts at different severity levels.
* Have the app send notification alerts to the user if their blood glucose level is entering a dangerous region.
* Add a mechanism for alcohol entry (potentially similar to insulin entry, with an icon on the right-hand side which allows entry of name, number of units and time that the alcohol was consumed).
* Make the trend arrow rotate to correspond to blood glucose level trajectory.
* Add the insulin dose calculated by the algorithm to the graph and have the option to expand it to access more detailed information.
* Add a temporary basal rate y-axis on the right-hand side of the display.
* Get the edit meal button in the food section working.
* Ability to take pictures of meals by clicking on the camera icon in the corresponding row and possibly allow favourite meal selection via the food carousel described in the design process section.
* Add a 'cancel' or 'remove' button below the 'edit' button for meals so users can inform the app they have changed their mind about having a certain meal.
* All the cells in the exercise log to expand to make room for an edit button and then get this button working so users can cancel or change the duration/time of exercise.
* Change the exercise intensity picker to a dual picker so the user can select whether their exercise activity was aerobic, anaerobic or mixed as well as if it's low, medium or high intensity.
* Make the app capable of identifying and reporting trends to the user in the advice domain.
* Make it automatically create summary graphs from the data, for instance average blood glucose level against time of day, number of hypos against day of the week etc. Then allow the user to swipe through these charts and click on the expand button to display them in a pop-up for a more detailed view.
* Link the exercise and advice status indicators up to the actual content in the sections (currently they are just cosmetic) and provide the option to swipe through indicators.
