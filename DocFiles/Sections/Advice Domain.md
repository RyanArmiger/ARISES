## Features
* Expanding "notification" to show suggestions

## Current State
* All UI elements are placeholders as content for this section remained uncertain until after the focus group and the time constraints of the project. 

## Future work
* Generate graphs of average glucose values for different times of day and week
* Allow it to spot and display trends from these graphs or data values
* Offer suggestions based on the trends identified
* Add status indicators to show notifications or other useful trend information
