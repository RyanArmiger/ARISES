## About this documentation

This documentation has been generated using [Jazzy](https://github.com/realm/jazzy). The [.jazzy.yaml](https://github.com/danwells96/ARISES/blob/master/.jazzy.yaml) file in the project folder is a configuration file used to direct the program to the location of the markdown files to be included. It also defines custom categories for each included file, to create a more logical documentation format. 

### Installing Jazzy
* Jazzy must be installed in the command line using ``` [sudo] gem install jazzy ```
* The Xcode command-line developer tools must be installed using  ``` xcode-select --install ``` if not already

### Updating Documentation with Jazzy
* Edit the markdown files provided in [DocFiles](https://github.com/danwells96/ARISES/tree/master/DocFiles) or add comments to functions within the code
* Navigate to the project file in the terminal and type ```jazzy```
* Check out your newly updated documentation website in [docs](https://github.com/danwells96/ARISES/tree/master/docs)
